    <p class="moreinfo">My Family has known Chris Carroll for over 7 years...  My boys have taken Drivers Education with Chris and have learned many skills in life... in the classroom and in their hearts....  The Carroll's have been more than teachers, they have been Friends and most importantly Role Models for our boys and others.

    <p class="moreinfo">Chris taught both my daughters to drive.  He not only helped them with their skills but also gave them confidence in their abilities.  I would highly recommend him!

      <p class="moreinfo">I am a recent graduate of Lake Norman High School where Mr. Carroll taught me and served as my driving instructor.  During the weeks that I rode with Mr. Carroll, my driving abilities increased tenfold, as well as my knowledge of how other drivers are going to act while on the roads.  He taught me that driving is a serious task where lives are at risk if you do not take caution, and I have  taken that mindset every time I step into a car, and I couldn't be more grateful.  I highly recommend Chris Carroll to teach your kids safe and responsible driving techniques for years to come.
